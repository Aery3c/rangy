        <b>Association football</b> is a sport played between two teams. It is usually called
        <b class="pinkLink">football</b>, but in some countries, such as the United States, it is called
        <b>soccer</b>. In <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</a>, New Zealand, South Africa,
        Australia, Canada and Republic of Ireland, both words are commonly used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each team has 11 players on the field. One of these players is the <i>goalkeeper</i>, and the other ten are
        known as <i>"outfield players."</i> The game is played by <b>kicking a ball
        <img src="football.png" width="100" height="100" alt="football"> into the opponent's goal</b>. A
        match has 90 minutes of play, with a break of 15 minutes in the middle. The break in the middle is called
        half-time.

    <p contenteditable="true">
        There are many competitions for football, for both football clubs and countries. Football clubs usually play
        other teams in their own country, with a few exceptions. <b>Cardiff City F.C.</b> from Wales for example, play
        in the English leagues and in the English FA Cup.

Football is the world's most popular sport. It is played in more
countries than any other game. In fact, FIFA (the Federation
Internationale de Football Association) has more members than the
